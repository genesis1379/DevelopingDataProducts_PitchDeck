## Overview of "What's in Your Food" | App is a tool for nutrition insight discovery and visualization 

<div class="columns-2">
<p>Ever wonder how much dietary fiber is in your burrito? </p>
<p>Ever wonder what you should eat to maximize your protein intake while minimizing your fat intake?</P>
<p><b>You can use this app to answer those questions and more.</b></p>

## How does it add value? | "What's in Your Food?" provides insights through interactive visualization

#### Detailed nutrition facts
- Data are from the <a href = "http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/">USDA's Nutrition Database</a> which, while not visually friendly, is the go-to source for accurate and detailed nutrition data

#### Easy to use
- Users can navigate foods with an interactive graph or table
- Filters and search help users find subsets of food easily and creatively

#### Visual
- Users can plot foods by nutrient values and food groups and quickly visualize their findings
- Dynamic tooltips make weaving through the data much easier

## What data are in the app? | Users can analyze 8617 foods based on 46 nutritional content indicators

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
source("global.r")
require(ggvis)
require(dplyr)
require(RSQLite)
require(knitr)
require(treemap)

db <- src_sqlite("Food.sqlite")
food <- tbl(db, "Food")
df <- food %>%
  filter(
    Energy >= 0,
    Energy <= 1000)
df <- as.data.frame(df)
```

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width = 7.5, fig.align='center'}
food_count <- as.data.frame(table(df$FoodGroup))
treemap(food_count, "Var1", "Freq", fontface.labels = "plain", 
        title = "Composition of Nutrition Data Frame for App")
```

## Further applications and development | This app can be further improved upon for added functionality

<div class="columns-2">
<div class = "heading"><p>Who can use this?</p></div>
<br>

- Dieticians and nutritionists
- Chefs
- The USDA and NDA (and other government organizations)
- Researchers and food studies students
- Anyone trying to maximize or minimize intake of a specific nutrient
- The curious and bored!

<br><br>

<div class = "heading"><p>Future features</p></div>
<br>

- Food recommendation function which takes an input of a set of objectives and provides a list of foods that meet those objectives 
- <b>Example:</b> <i>Input objective to minimize sodium while maximizing iron intake, output is a list of foods with the highest iron to sodium ratio</i>
- Ability to click on an ingredient on the chart and display the ingredient makeup in a separate chart beside it
